# Basic frontend

This frontend-only asset canister allows you to serve static files without a backend canister.
Asset canisters can be used to serve static frontend files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, to users through a web browser.

## What is ICP Ninja?

ICP Ninja is a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) for the Internet Computer. It allows you to write code and deploy applications directly from your web browser in a temporary, sandbox-like environment.

For users who may already be familiar with the Internet Computer or who would rather use more **advanced tooling** such as command-line development tools, please refer to the [ICP developer documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/getting-started/install) to learn more.

## Project structure
